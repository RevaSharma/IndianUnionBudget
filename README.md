Indian Union Budget- Data Viz. App

Starting out as a novice in the data visualization field, I have create a data viz. application based on the Indian Union Budget of India. The Union Budget of a year is a statement of the estimated receipts and expenditure of the government for that particular fiscal year (1st April to 31st March). This is a beginner's data visualization that has been created in Python. I have made use of the following python libraries and packages:

1.pandas
2.dash,dash_core_components,dash_html_components 
3.plotly express,plotly.graph_objects,plotly.io
4.dash_auth

Through this data visualization I have tried to explain the Indian Union Budget through a couple of plots and figures- namely a line chart and a pie chart. 

1. Union Budget is classified into Revenue Budget and Capital Budget. The line chart displays the increasing trend of the Indian Union Budget between the years 2010-2021. The x-axis represents the session years and the y-axis represents the budget allocated (in Rupee crores). Clicking on the dropdown will also allow you to see the trend of the Revenue and Capital Receipts.

2. The pie chart displays how the Indian Union Budget for the session 2020-2021 has been allocated amongst various ministries and departments. Hovering over each slice will give us the name of the ministry/dept, the amount allocated to it and its respective percentage of the whole budget. The following customisations are possible with the pie chart:
 * Clicking once on the relevant minstry/dept from the legend will remove it from the pie chart
 * Clicking twice on the relevant ministry/dept from the legend will isolate it. We can then further click once on other ministries/depts that we want and they will get added to the pie chart
